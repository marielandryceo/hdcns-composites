Known properties of hemp fiber, specifically when considered as a reinforcement in composite materials. Unlike hemp oil (modified) or lignin, which can act as matrix components, hemp fiber's primary role in composites is to provide mechanical strength and stiffness.

Again, properties can vary significantly based on hemp variety, growing conditions, part of the stalk used (bast fibers are strongest), retting process (how fibers are separated – dew, water, enzyme, chemical), and processing (decortication, cleaning, alignment).

Here are the key properties relevant to its use as a composite reinforcement:

1. Source & Sustainability:

Bio-based & Renewable: Directly sourced from the hemp plant stem.

Carbon Sequestration: Hemp plants absorb significant CO₂ during growth.

Potential Biodegradability: The fiber itself is biodegradable, although the composite's overall biodegradability depends heavily on the matrix.

Lower Energy Production: Requires significantly less energy to produce compared to glass or carbon fibers.

Agricultural Crop: Utilizes agricultural land; farming practices impact overall sustainability.

2. Structure & Composition:

Lignocellulosic Nature: Composed primarily of:

Cellulose (~60-75%): The main structural component, consisting of crystalline regions (providing stiffness/strength) and amorphous regions, arranged in microfibrils. High degree of polymerization.

Hemicellulose (~15-25%): Acts as a binder between cellulose microfibrils, more branched and amorphous, highly hydrophilic.

Lignin (~2-10%): Acts as a binder/matrix encasing cellulose and hemicellulose, providing rigidity and compressive strength to the plant stem. More hydrophobic than cellulose/hemicellulose.

Pectins, Waxes, Ash: Minor components affecting surface properties and interactions.

Hierarchical Structure: Elementary fibers (diameter ~10-30 µm) are bundled together by lignin/pectin into larger "technical fibers" (diameter ~50-500 µm or larger). Composite properties depend on whether elementary fibers are well-separated and impregnated.

Semi-Crystalline: Cellulose provides significant crystallinity. Microfibril Angle (MFA) - the angle of the cellulose microfibrils relative to the fiber axis - is relatively low in hemp, contributing to its stiffness.

3. Mechanical Properties:

Good Specific Stiffness & Strength: Hemp fiber exhibits excellent specific Young's Modulus and specific Tensile Strength (property divided by density). It is often comparable to or even better than E-glass fiber in specific stiffness, making it attractive for lightweight applications.

Moderate Absolute Stiffness & Strength:

Young's Modulus: Typically ranges from 20 to 70 GPa, sometimes reported higher for highly processed elementary fibers. This is lower than E-glass (~70-75 GPa) and much lower than carbon fiber (200+ GPa).

Tensile Strength: Typically ranges from 500 to 1000 MPa, sometimes higher for elementary fibers. Again, generally lower than E-glass (~1500-2500 MPa) and carbon fiber (3000+ MPa).

Variability: Mechanical properties are highly sensitive to fiber diameter, defects (kink bands), plant source, processing methods, retting degree, and moisture content. This variability is a major challenge compared to synthetic fibers.

Low Elongation at Break: Typically around 1-4%, making composites potentially brittle if fiber-dominated.

4. Physical Properties:

Low Density: Around 1.4 - 1.5 g/cm³, significantly lower than E-glass (~2.5-2.6 g/cm³) and slightly lower than typical carbon fiber (~1.7-1.8 g/cm³). This is key to its excellent specific properties.

Hydrophilic: Due to the abundance of hydroxyl groups (-OH) in cellulose and hemicellulose, hemp fiber readily absorbs moisture from the environment (typically 8-12% moisture content at standard conditions). This leads to:

Swelling and dimensional changes.

Changes in mechanical properties (often reduced stiffness/strength when wet).

Poor compatibility/adhesion with hydrophobic polymer matrices (like PP, PE).

Potential for degradation via hydrolysis or microbial attack in humid conditions.

Hollow Lumen: Technical fibers often have a central cavity (lumen), which affects density and can influence resin impregnation and potentially provide some acoustic/thermal insulation.

5. Thermal Properties:

Limited Thermal Stability: Cellulose begins to degrade around 200-250°C, with hemicellulose degrading even earlier. Lignin degrades over a broader, higher range. This limits the processing temperature for thermoplastic composites, typically keeping it below ~200°C to avoid significant fiber degradation, loss of strength, and volatile emissions. This makes processing with high-temperature thermoplastics (Nylon, PC, PEEK) very challenging or impossible without degradation.

Low Thermal Conductivity: Acts as a thermal insulator compared to synthetic fibers like carbon or glass.

Low Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE): CTE along the fiber axis is low, but transverse CTE is higher and affected by moisture.

6. Interfacial Properties (Crucial for Composites):

Poor Adhesion to Hydrophobic Matrices: The polar, hydrophilic surface of hemp fiber creates a weak interface with non-polar, hydrophobic matrices like polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), leading to poor stress transfer and suboptimal composite performance.

Better Adhesion to Polar Matrices: Generally shows better (but not always perfect) adhesion to polar matrices like epoxies, polyesters, polylactic acid (PLA), and polyurethanes (PU) due to potential for hydrogen bonding.

Surface Treatments Essential: Chemical or physical surface treatments are often required to improve interfacial adhesion, especially with hydrophobic matrices. Common treatments include:

Alkali treatment (mercerization): Removes hemicellulose/lignin, increases surface roughness and cellulose crystallinity.

Silane treatment: Forms chemical bridges between fiber hydroxyls and the matrix.

Acetylation: Makes fiber surface more hydrophobic.

Use of compatibilizers/coupling agents (e.g., Maleic Anhydride grafted Polypropylene - MAPP for PP composites).

7. Processing Considerations for Composites:

Moisture Removal: Fibers must be thoroughly dried before melt processing with thermoplastics to prevent void formation and hydrolytic degradation of the matrix/fiber.

Dispersion: Achieving uniform dispersion of individual fibers (especially short fibers) in a matrix without excessive clumping can be difficult.

Fiber Damage: Hemp fibers can be damaged (broken, shortened) during high-shear processing like extrusion or injection molding, reducing the reinforcement effect.

Temperature Limitation: Processing temperature must be kept below the fiber degradation point (~200°C).

In Summary:

Hemp fiber is a promising bio-based reinforcement offering low density, high specific mechanical properties, sustainability benefits (renewable, CO₂ uptake, low production energy), and good insulation. However, its use faces challenges related to its inherent variability, hydrophilic nature (leading to moisture absorption and poor bonding with non-polar matrices), and limited thermal stability, which restricts processing options and necessitates careful drying and often surface treatments for optimal composite performance.
