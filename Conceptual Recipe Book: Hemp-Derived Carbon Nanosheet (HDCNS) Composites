Prepared By: Marie Seshat Landry (Conceptual Framework)
Purpose: To propose theoretical formulations for experimental validation by the global scientific community, fostering open-source development of novel hemp-based materials.
Reference Document: "Beating Climate Change with Hemp Nanotechnology" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15164887)

General Notes & Caveats:

Theoretical: These are not validated protocols but suggested starting compositions.

Component Variability: Properties of HDCNS (sheet size, thickness, defects, surface chemistry), Hemp Oil Epoxy (epoxidation degree, purity), and Hemp Lignin (source, extraction method, purity, reactivity) will significantly impact outcomes. Assume components meet reasonable quality standards for initial trials.

Dispersion is Key: Achieving uniform HDCNS dispersion is critical and often challenging. Notes suggest potential methods, but optimization is required (e.g., solvent choice, sonication parameters, shear mixing, use of surfactants/compatibilizers).

Processing: Suggested methods (solution mixing, melt compounding, etc.) are typical starting points. Curing profiles (time, temp, pressure) for thermosets must be optimized.

Weight vs. Volume: Percentages are typically given in weight percent (wt%) unless otherwise specified, but volume percent (vol%) may be more relevant for some properties. Conversion requires density data.

Safety: Standard laboratory safety protocols for handling nanomaterials, chemicals, solvents, and processing equipment must be followed.

Optimization: Every recipe will require significant experimental optimization.

Part 1: "Diamond Composites" - 100% Hemp-Derived (HDCNS + Hemp Oil Epoxy + Hemp Lignin Resin)

Goal: Explore the synergistic potential of an all-hemp system. Variations focus on HDCNS loading and the ratio of the bio-resin components.

Matrix Base: Blend of Hemp Oil Epoxy (HOE) and Hemp Lignin Resin (HLR). Assume HOE acts as the primary epoxy base and HLR acts as a co-resin, potentially contributing rigidity or acting as a reactive filler/hardener depending on its form. The HOE:HLR ratio dictates matrix flexibility/rigidity.

Processing Notes for Diamond Composites:

Likely requires solvent assistance (e.g., using a solvent compatible with both HOE and HLR, like THF, DMSO, or specific bio-solvents) for HDCNS dispersion via sonication/shear mixing, followed by solvent removal.

Appropriate curing agent/initiator system needed for the HOE/HLR blend (might depend on lignin reactivity - could be amine, anhydride, or catalytic curing). Curing temperatures and times need empirical determination.
