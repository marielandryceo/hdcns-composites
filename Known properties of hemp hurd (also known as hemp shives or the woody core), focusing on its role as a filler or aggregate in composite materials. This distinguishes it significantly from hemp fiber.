Known properties of hemp hurd (also known as hemp shives or the woody core), focusing on its role as a filler or aggregate in composite materials. This distinguishes it significantly from hemp fiber.

Hemp hurd is the porous, lightweight inner core of the hemp stalk remaining after the outer bast fibers have been removed during decortication. Its properties are influenced by hemp variety, growth conditions, and especially the size and shape distribution resulting from processing (grinding, sieving).

Here are the key properties relevant to its use in composites:

1. Source & Sustainability:

Bio-based & Renewable: Derived from the hemp plant.

Abundant Byproduct: Often considered a lower-value co-product of hemp fiber production, making its utilization important for the overall economic viability and sustainability of hemp processing. Contributes to full biomass utilization.

Carbon Storage: Represents sequestered atmospheric CO₂ locked into the plant biomass.

Biodegradable: Like other lignocellulosic materials, it is biodegradable under appropriate conditions.

2. Structure & Composition:

Cellular Woody Structure: Consists of short, randomly oriented woody cells with thin walls and significant void space (porosity).

Lignocellulosic Composition: Contains:

Cellulose (~40-50%): Lower cellulose content compared to bast fibers.

Hemicellulose (~20-30%): Similar or slightly higher relative content compared to fibers.

Lignin (~20-30%): Significantly higher lignin content compared to bast fibers, contributing to its woody nature.

Pectins, Extractives, Ash: Minor components.

Particle Morphology: Typically exists as irregular, chunky particles or flakes. The size and aspect ratio are highly dependent on processing (hammer milling, sieving) and are critical parameters for composite properties. Aspect ratio is much lower than technical fibers.

High Porosity: Possesses a very high internal porosity and surface area due to its cellular structure.

3. Mechanical Properties (as a Filler/Aggregate):

Low Intrinsic Strength & Stiffness: The hurd material itself has much lower tensile strength and stiffness compared to the oriented cellulose structure of the bast fibers.

Role as Filler: Primarily acts as a low-density filler or aggregate, not as a primary reinforcing agent in the way fibers do.

Effect on Composite Strength: Adding hurd to a polymer matrix generally decreases tensile and flexural strength, especially at higher loadings, because the particles act as stress concentration points and the interface is often weak.

Effect on Composite Stiffness: Can slightly increase the stiffness (Young's Modulus) of a polymer matrix at very low loadings, but often decreases it or has minimal effect at higher practical loadings compared to reinforcing fibers.

Impact Resistance: Effect is variable; low loadings might slightly improve toughness by crack deflection, but higher loadings often lead to brittleness due to poor interfaces and particle defects.

Compressive Strength: Can contribute positively to compressive strength, particularly in systems like hempcrete where it forms a packed structure bound by lime.

4. Physical Properties:

Very Low Density: Bulk density is extremely low (e.g., ~100-150 kg/m ³ or 0.1-0.15 g/cm³), making it excellent for producing lightweight composites. Particle density is higher but still significantly lower than most polymers or mineral fillers.

Highly Absorbent: Extremely high water and oil absorption capacity due to its porous structure and hydrophilic components (cellulose, hemicellulose). This is a major challenge for use in polymer composites:

Requires extensive drying before processing (especially melt processing).

Can absorb moisture from the environment, causing swelling and dimensional instability in the final composite.

Leads to poor interfacial adhesion with hydrophobic matrices.

Can cause void formation during processing if moisture turns to steam.

Hydrophilic: Predominantly hydrophilic surface character.

5. Thermal Properties:

Excellent Thermal Insulator: The high porosity and trapped air make hemp hurd a very effective thermal insulation material. This property is leveraged in hempcrete and can contribute significantly to the thermal insulation of composites.

Low Thermal Conductivity: Consequently has very low thermal conductivity values.

Limited Thermal Stability: Similar degradation profile to hemp fiber, with hemicellulose and cellulose degradation starting below/around 200-250°C. This restricts processing temperatures for thermoplastic composites to below ~200°C.

Combustible: Like all dry biomass. Can contribute to char formation under heating.

6. Interfacial Properties (Crucial for Composites):

Generally Poor Adhesion: The hydrophilic nature leads to poor bonding with common hydrophobic matrices (PP, PE, etc.). Even with polar matrices (epoxies, PLA), achieving good wetting and strong adhesion can be challenging due to surface chemistry and porosity.

Surface Treatments Often Necessary: Similar treatments as for fiber (alkali, silane, acetylation, MAPP etc.) are often employed to improve interfacial adhesion and reduce moisture sensitivity, although uniformly treating the porous, irregular surface can be difficult.

Porosity Impact: High surface porosity can physically trap matrix material, offering some mechanical interlocking, but can also trap air leading to voids at the interface if wetting is poor.

7. Processing Considerations for Composites:

Extensive Drying: Mandatory before melt processing to avoid processing defects and degradation.

Dispersion: Achieving uniform dispersion without agglomeration, especially for finer particles, is important.

Feeding Challenges: Very low bulk density can make consistent feeding into extruders difficult. Pre-pelletizing or compaction might be needed.

High Filler Loading Issues: High loadings needed for significant weight reduction can drastically increase melt viscosity, reduce strength, and make processing difficult.

Void Formation: High risk due to moisture release during heating.

Temperature Limits: Strict processing temperature control (<200°C) is required.

Primary Roles in Composites:

Lightweight Filler: Reducing density is its main advantage.

Thermal Insulating Component: Leveraging its low thermal conductivity.

Acoustic Insulating Component: Porosity also contributes to sound absorption.

Aggregate in Bio-Concretes: Key component in hemp-lime ("hempcrete") construction materials, providing insulation and moisture buffering.

Core Material: Can be used as a core in lightweight sandwich panels.

Absorbent Applications: Used directly for absorption (animal bedding, spill control), but this property is usually detrimental in structural composites.

In summary, hemp hurd is a highly porous, very low-density, insulating, and absorbent lignocellulosic aggregate. Its primary benefits in composites are weight reduction and thermal/acoustic insulation. Its main challenges stem from its high moisture absorption, hydrophilic nature (poor interface), and limited thermal stability, requiring careful drying, surface treatments, and controlled processing, especially when used with polymer matrices. It is fundamentally different from hemp fiber and does not act as a primary reinforcing agent for tensile/flexural strength.
